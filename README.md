# About: 
We want create system for handling various tasks on systems automaticaly. As a example we can use firewalls. On each server will be running client sending information to server where we have iptables module which is connecting servers together based in groups defined on server side. When new client is connected it will get set of rules (predefined + dynamic) Dynamic rules are generated by IP's of servers in groups ( you can generate rules based on all servers in groups).
